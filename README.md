# Creation of the SoupToken

The provided code defines a Solidity smart contract named "MySoupToken" that represents a basic cryptocurrency. It includes public variables for token name, abbreviation, and total supply, a mapping to store balances of addresses, a "mint" function to create new tokens and increase the balance of a specific address, and a "burn" function to destroy tokens by reducing the total supply and an address's balance, with a conditional check to ensure the address has enough tokens to burn. The contract is governed by the MIT license.

## Description

This Solidity smart contract, named "MySoupToken," is designed to create a basic cryptocurrency. It features public variables to store essential information about the token, such as its name ("Soup"), abbreviation ("SP"), and total supply (set at 2000 tokens). The contract includes a mapping to keep track of token balances for various addresses, a "mint" function to generate new tokens and increase the balance of a specified address, and a "burn" function to destroy tokens, reducing the total supply and an address's balance, provided the address holds enough tokens to be burned. The contract also adheres to the MIT license for its licensing terms.
